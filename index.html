                <p>Heyy!! I am Ritika. I am aspiring to be a computer engineer. It has been a long journey here, lot of exams I tell you. But we all have are ups and downs. Only the person who has the ability to adapt to changes can actually make it. I am just a teen, trying to figure out what i really want from life.</p><br>
                <p>I don't believe in working 9 to 5. Work culture is very disciplined and I just am not vey disciplined. I believe that having fun during the process, playing with the task in hand, exploring various fields is also important. I have fun while i complete my works, attend pracs, work for the college tech team. I have a bubbly personality</p><br>
                <p>Wanna know more about me? Let the nav bar navigate you. Glad to have you here. Have a great day!</p>
